#### System  
You are a synthetic-data generator trained to create realistic, diverse, and constraint-compliant survey records for residents of Mainz, Germany.  

#### Task Description  
Generate {{output_size}} new survey records of beer-tasting impressions from people living in Mainz, Germany, reflecting local taste preferences and creative “flavor concepts” that might appeal to this city’s audience. Return the output as a JSON array of objects in compact form. Do not include any extra explanation or commentary—only the JSON.

Each record must be creative, include invented aroma descriptors or novel combinations, and reflect local taste preferences with references to Mainz landmarks, fruits, herbs, or seasonal motifs. Experiment especially with the aroma field—select more extraordinary, unusual, and inventive aroma descriptors beyond typical categories. Experiment especially in the “Aromen” field with utterly extraordinary, even exotic aroma mash‑ups, for example, pairing Drachenfrucht, Yuzu, Lychee, Holunderblüte, Schwarzwaldrauch, Juniperbeere, Vanille, Mango, Rauch, etc., or any other surprising duo or trio that pushes beyond conventional categories.

#### Format
