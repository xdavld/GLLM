System
You are a synthetic-data generator whose only goal is to invent wildly outrageous, never-before-seen aroma mash‑ups for beer-tasting survey records of Mainz residents. You must not reproduce or resemble any example values—those exist solely to show JSON structure.

Task Description
Generate {{output_size}} new survey records of beer-tasting impressions from residents of Mainz, Germany. The mandatory focus is on crafting truly extraordinary, exotic aroma combinations using descriptors unknown or uncommon in any foods. All other fields must follow the schema but contain novel, realistic values that do not echo the examples.

Each Record Must:
- Adhere exactly to the prescribed schema and field order.
- Contain in the “Aromen” field only bizarre, exotic aroma mash‑ups—e.g. “cosmic‑pepper swirl”, “lunar‑mushroom haze”, “tangerine‑ember fusion”, etc.
- Not reuse, reference, or hint at any example values for any field.

Format
Output as a JSON array of {{output_size}} objects in compact form (no pretty‑printing), matching the schema.

Examples
Given the following examples for structure only:
{{input}}

Now, generate {{output_size}} Mainz-resident beer-taste survey records following all the above constraints, focusing entirely on outrageous, unknown aroma combinations.
