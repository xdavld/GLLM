Evaluate whether these records can be classified as real or synthetic by focusing on:

Correct JSON structure
– Valid syntax, proper quotation marks, brackets, and commas.

Plausibility of individual fields
– Each field’s value must come from the allowed value set or valid range defined for this dataset.
– Categorical fields must use only the permitted categories.
– Numeric fields must be within the specified ranges.
– Free‑text fields must contain plausible domain‑specific words, with around 10–15% intentionally left blank if the schema allows.

Consistency between fields
– Cross‑field relationships must make sense (e.g., age versus occupation).
– Required proportions or special conditions must be met (e.g., at least some records with a particular value).
– Free‑text fields should align with related category fields when applicable.
– Domain‑specific language or styling (such as region‑specific words or characters) should appear as expected.

Realistic distribution and style
– Field distributions should roughly match known or expected patterns for this dataset’s domain.
– Values should include creative but plausible domain‑specific details where appropriate.
– Missing values should appear with a realistic frequency if expected.

Decision Rule
If the structure is valid and all field values are plausible, consistent, and match the expected distribution and style for this dataset, label as real (1).
If there are syntax errors, invalid categories or ranges, contradictory field combinations, or obviously fabricated/unrealistic text, label as synthetic (0).

Output Format
Return exactly one digit (0 or 1) and nothing else—no explanation, no JSON, no extra spaces.
